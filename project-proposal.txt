1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin have rapidly gained traction
as decentralized financial systems, but their pseudonymous nature
has also made them attractive for illicit transactions, including
money laundering, ransomware payments, and dark web trade, due
to the high degree of anonymity that can be achieved [5 ]. However,
these networks are made of a large number of nodes and a massive
volume of transactions. Each transaction can link to multiple ad-
dresses, making it difficult to establish clear ownership patterns or
detect hidden clusters of criminal activity [3 ]. This makes tracking
and analyzing illicit transactions a difficult and computationally
intensive task. There is a subsequent reduction in the ability for
enforcement, regulators, and researchers to analyze and respond
appropriately to changing dynamics within these networks.
With the advent of GPU-accelerated databases, such as Sirius [6 ],
there could be opportunities to improve the performance of these
typically graph-based queries and analyses. By leveraging massive
parallelism on GPUs, such systems can process large volumes of
data and execute complex graph queries much faster than CPU-
based architectures [2, 4]. A demonstrable improvement in the
performance of this analysis could open future doorways to tracking
and managing these types of transactions. As such, our primary
goal is to determine whether we can enhance the efficiency of
analyzing Bitcoin transactions for illicit activity by utilizing Sirius,
a GPU-accelerated database.
The public availability of data from the largest networks also
provides a great opportunity for data access, with multiple datasets
already available. The full transaction log can be scraped manually,
if needed [3].
1.2 Motivation
The motivation behind this project lies in the urgent need for scal-
able and efficient tools to analyze blockchain transaction data at
scale. As cryptocurrencies continue to expand globally, the size
and complexity of their underlying transaction graphs have grown
exponentially, posing major challenges for traditional CPU-based
analytical systems [5 ]. Identifying illicit financial behavior within
these massive networks requires rapid querying, clustering, and
pattern detection over billions of edges and nodes. However, such
analyses are often too computationally intensive to perform in real
time using conventional databases. Leveraging GPU-accelerated
databases like Sirius offers a promising alternative — providing
parallelized data processing capabilities that can significantly re-
duce latency in graph traversal, aggregation, and anomaly detection
tasks [1, 6].
Furthermore, efficient blockchain analysis has real-world impli-
cations in enhancing financial transparency and supporting law
enforcement agencies in combating cybercrime. Faster, GPU-driven
transaction analytics can enable proactive identification of money
laundering patterns, improve forensic investigations, and facili-
tate compliance with anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations [5].
Beyond the security domain, the outcomes of this project can ex-
tend to optimizing blockchain infrastructure, supporting economic
research, and improving network monitoring. By demonstrating
measurable performance gains with GPU acceleration, this work
aims to bridge the gap between large-scale blockchain data analysis
and actionable insights — paving the way for more responsive and
intelligent financial data systems [2, 4].
1.3 Challenges
Several challenges arise in evaluating GPU acceleration for blockchain
analytics. First, the Bitcoin transaction graph exhibits skewed de-
gree distributions, where a few nodes have disproportionately high
connectivity, creating load imbalance during parallel execution [3 ].
Second, GPU databases may be constrained by limited VRAM ca-
pacity, requiring careful data partitioning or streaming [1]. Finally,
ensuring fair performance comparisons between CPU- and GPU-
based systems necessitates controlling for hardware costs, query
optimization, and data transfer overheads between main memory
and device memory [6].
2 Task Plan
This project aims to evaluate the performance of graph queries on
GPU-accelerated databases by comparing Sirius with DuckDB using
real-world blockchain data. Specifically, we will model the Bitcoin
transaction network as a graph and run queries to detect connec-
tions between known illicit nodes and other transactions. The work
includes dataset preparation, query implementation on both sys-
tems, and benchmarking to measure scalability and speedup from
GPU acceleration.
Our key contributions include:(1) a comprehensive performance
comparison of CPU vs GPU graph databases for blockchain and
fraud detection workloads, (2) empirical characterization of when
GPU acceleration provides meaningful benefits based on graph size
and query complexity, and (3) a reusable benchmark framework and
preprocessed dataset to support future research on GPU-accelerated
graph analytics.
2.1 Dataset
The project uses the Elliptic Bitcoin Transaction Dataset [ 5], an
anonymized transaction graph derived from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Each node represents a transaction, and each edge captures the
flow of Bitcoins between transactions. The dataset includes about
203,769 nodes and 234,355 edges, with roughly 2% labeled as illicit
and 21% as licit. The labeled nature of the Elliptic dataset provides
an ideal basis for experiments that combine structural analysis with
classification-oriented workloads.
We plan to begin with a subset of 10K nodes to ensure manage-
able testing, then scale to 50K, 100K, and the full 200K+ nodes to
evaluate performance as data volume increases. The preprocessing
pipeline will be implemented in Python and the cleaned data will be
converted into formats compatible with both DuckDB and Sirius.
2.2 Query on DuckDB
We will first implement all graph queries on DuckDB as a CPU-
based baseline. Our main query types will include:
• 1-hop and 2-hop reachability: starting from known illicit
nodes to detect directly and indirectly connected transac-
tions.
• k-hop traversal: exploring multi-step relationships among
transactions up to 3 or 4 hops away.
• Path analysis: computing the shortest path distance to
measure how far each node is from the nearest known illicit
node
2.3 Query on Sirius
After establishing our query suite in DuckDB, we will replicate
equivalent graph queries on Sirius to test GPU acceleration. Sirius
integrates with DuckDB through the Substrait query interface, en-
abling compatible SQL queries to be executed directly on the GPU
without major query rewrites.
Performance and correctness will be verified by comparing query
outputs with DuckDB results. This stage will demonstrate how
GPU acceleration affects query latency and scalability for graph
workloads.
2.4 Benchmarking and Evaluation
We will conduct systematic benchmarking to compare DuckDB
(CPU) and Sirius (GPU) performance under identical conditions.
Each query will be executed multiple times on datasets of increasing
size to assess scalability and consistency.
The following metrics will be collected:
• Query execution time
• Memory/VRAM usage
• CPU/GPU utilization
Benchmark results will be visualized through comparative bar
charts and scalability curves to clearly illustrate performance trends.
We will explore which types of queries benefit most from GPU ac-
celeration, analyze the graph size threshold where GPU advantages
emerge, and identify cases where computation falls back to CPU ex-
ecution. We expect GPU acceleration to yield significant speedups
on multi-hop and path queries, with diminishing returns for simpler
one-hop traversals.
